# Case-Study_Analyzing_Diabetes_Issues_Among_Pima_Women_Exploratory_Data_Analysis

Context
Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe. In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima tribe.

Objective
Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Diabetes Analysis by doing Exploratory Data Analysis.
